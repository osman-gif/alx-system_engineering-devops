This is command_line_for_the_win project(a fun game for improving cmd skills).
In this project I will solve the challenges and take screen shots of the 
completed projects, and then transfer them to the sandbox via SFTP (safe file transfer protocal)and I will demostrate how is used it to ransfer those screen shots.
After this step is done, I will send the screen shots to my GitHub account.

- Steps I used to transfer files using SFTP:
 1- First I completed the challenges and I took the screen shots
 2- Secondly I'm using ubuntue distro, so I issued a connection
    to my sandbox using this command " sftp username@hostname "
    then I was asked for my sandbox password and I provided it
 3- Then I sent the files to my sandbox via sftp using this command
    " sftp> put 0-fist_9_tasks ", and then the next 9 tasks .., after navig
    ating to the desired file.
