1-SERVER
	A server is a computer that provides services to other computers called clients, in most	cases its a computer with strong features with no keyboard, and it has an OS installed o	n it.
2-WEBSERVER
	A webserver is a software program, that recieves a http/https request and returns a
	and http/https response(most cases static response), if the response was dynamic then
	it delegates the request to other server side program or an app server
3-DNS RECORD TYPE(WWW)
	The www record type in www.foobar.com is a CNAME record, an alias to the foobar.com
	record
4-ROLE OF DOMAIN NAME
	It is simpler and easier to remember than the IP of the server that is hosting your
	side, for example the IP adderess of the server hosting the foobar.com is 192.1.34.5
	it is harder to remember right?, but if we use the domain name (foobar.com) then it is
	easy to remember and stright forward
5-APP SERVER
	An app server is a software application that process the application logic and execute
	application code (code base), it also connect to the database if needed
6-DATABASE SERVER
	The database server is used to store data in an organized way, make easy to restore and
	manage data
7-WHAT IS THE SERVER USING TO COMMUNICATE WITH USER'S COMPUTER
	It is using the http protocol

#ISSUES
	SPOF:
		The SINGE POINT OF FAILURE here are
		1- having only one sever, if it stopped then the whole system is stopped
		2- having only one app server, web server, database server and one codebase
		   if any one of this malfunctioned then the whole system will not function
		   properly
	DOWNTIME:
		When doing maintenance, the downtime of the system could be high, because
		we have only one component for every function of the system, and when
		maintenance of any component is taking place, that means the componet will
		be of duty and ther is no other componet that will replace it during the
		process
	TOO MUCH TRAFFIC:
		When the system is facing high rate of traffic, we can not scale it, because
		we have no load balancer
