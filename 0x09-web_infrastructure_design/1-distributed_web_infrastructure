1- ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS
	Each additional element added, is for high performance and availability,
	and elementating SPOF probelms
2- BALANCER DISTRIBUTING ALOGRITHM
	The loadbalancer is using the roundrobin alogrithm.
	How it works? This kind of algorithm distributes loads in a sequential order,
	for example if I have 3 servers A, B and C, and if I forward the first request to
	server A, the second to B and the third to C and recieved another request then it
	will got to A, and it will continue in this cycle
3- ACTIVE_ACTIVE or PASSIVE_ACTIVE
	The Loadbalancer is using the active_activer set up,
	Acive active sets up two servers to serve at the same time concurntly, while passive
	active sets up one server to serve, and the second server to stay in stand by, the
	second server can be promoted to the active state when the frist server is down
4- DATABASE (PRIMARY_REPLICA)
	The primary_replica works as follows. The primary database is the one responsible for
	all write operation, it does not recieves and read operation, while the replica is the
	one responsible for all read operations and it does not recieve and write operation.
	data are copied to the replica from the primary database
5- DIFFERENCE (PRIMAY AND REPLICA)
	The primary node is the MAIN node, it is the one that write and updates the database.
	The replica only gets its data from the primary node in a consistant manner, it handles 	all read operation.

#ISSUES
	SPOF:
		The only sigle point of failure here is the loadbalancer, if it went down
		then the system also go down
	SECURITY:
		Because there is no firewall and we are not using https, the hacker can steal
		our data and damage our system, to avoid this is to set up a firewall and use
		https protocol and have an SSL or TLS certificate
